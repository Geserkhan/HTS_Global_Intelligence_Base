BLX CORE (ADGM) → DMH BANK IB
    └── Reserve verification data for BLXWT-backed lending (Phase 2, post-2028)
    └── Consultation on digital asset structuring (NOT direct custody service)
    └── Monthly proof-of-reserve reports (data interface only)
    
BLX TRADING (ADGM) → DMH BANK CB
    └── Trade payment processing & LC issuance for petroleum transactions
    └── FX conversion services for oil trading settlements
    
DMHB DLT Foundation (DAO) → DMH BANK

- **Total Capital Ratio:** Minimum 8% → Target: 31.5% (3.94x buffer)

### 3.2 Phase 1 Capital Source (2027 Q1) - Gold Provenance & AML Compliance

**Capital Conversion Verification:**
```
ADGM Gold Reserves (End 2026): 28,250 oz (1 tonne)
    ↓
Gold Market Value: USD 67.8M (at USD 2,400/oz conservative)
    ↓
Convert 20,000 oz → USD 48M cash
    ↓
Transfer USD 4.2M → HTS DAO Holdings (Labuan)
    ↓
Deposit RM 20M → DMH BANK initial capital
    ↓
Remaining Gold: 8,250 oz (USD 19.8M) → BLXWT backing reserve (Phase 2)
```

**LBMA Certification & AML Traceability:**

All gold reserves converted for DMH BANK capitalization originate exclusively from:

1. **LBMA-Accredited Refineries:**
   - Primary Source: LBMA Good Delivery List certified refineries
   - Chain of Custody: Mine → LBMA Refinery → BLX TRADING → Liquidation
   - Serial Numbers: Each gold bar tracked via LBMA-certified assay certificate

2. **AML/CFT Documentation:**
   - **Due Diligence Provider:** Refinitiv World-Check (screening at purchase)
   - **Conflict Minerals Certification:** OECD Due Diligence Guidance compliant
   - **Sanctions Screening:** OFAC/UN/EU lists (zero-tolerance policy)
   - **Transaction Monitoring:** All gold purchases screened via Chainalysis

3. **Audit Trail:**
   - EY Audit Report: "Gold Reserve Provenance Verification (2026)"
   - Transfer Documentation: ADGM → Labuan fund transfer includes gold sale invoices
   - Bank Statements: USD 48M from gold sale (Q4 2026)

**AML/CFT Compliance Statement:**
> "In accordance with ADGM's Virtual Asset AML Guidance 2025 and Malaysia's AMLA 2001, all gold assets liquidated for DMH BANK capitalization have undergone enhanced due diligence. **All gold reserves are sourced exclusively from LBMA-accredited refineries, ensuring full AML/CFT traceability** from mining source through LBMA-accredited refining to final conversion."

**Capital Source Supporting Documents (Annex 5):**
- **Annex 5A:** LBMA Refinery Good Delivery Certification
- **Annex 5B:** EY Gold Provenance Audit Report (2026)
- **Annex 5C:** Refinitiv World-Check Sanctions Screening Report
- **Annex 5D:** OECD Conflict Minerals Due Diligence Declaration
- **Annex 5E:** ADGM Bank Statement (USD 48M gold sale proceeds)

### 3.3 Phase 2 Capital Enhancement (2028) - BLXWT as Non-Redeemable Collateral

**BLXWT Definition (FSRA 2025 Framework Compliant):**

> "BLXWT qualifies as a **non-redeemable, fully-backed commodity-linked virtual asset** under ADGM FSRA's 2025 Virtual Asset Framework, NOT a payment token or fiat-referenced stablecoin. BLXWT represents proportional ownership data of physical gold reserves held under BLX CORE custody (Category 3C - Managing Assets), without redemption rights or return guarantees."

**Regulatory Classification:**
- **Asset Class:** Digital commodity certificate (similar to gold ETF shares, but non-tradable)
- **FSRA Status:** Regulated under Category 3C "Managing Assets" (NOT Payment Services)
- **Backing Ratio:** 1:1 physical gold (verified monthly by EY proof-of-reserve)
- **Redeemability:** NONE - Token holders cannot redeem for fiat or physical gold
- **Secondary Market:** Restricted to qualified institutional buyers only

**Phase 2 BLXWT Capital Structure (2028):**

```
Cumulative Gold Reserves (2027-2028): 36,500 oz
    ↓
Total Gold Value: USD 91.3M (at USD 2,500/oz)
    ↓
BLXWT Issued (10% max): USD 9.1M token supply
    ↓
Conservative Haircut (90%): USD 8.21M eligible as Tier 1 supplement
    ↓
Total Enhanced Tier 1 Capital: USD 12.41M (USD 4.2M cash + USD 8.21M BLXWT)
    ↓
Capital Enhancement: +196% expansion vs. Phase 1
```

**Labuan FSA Approval Strategy (2028 Q2 Application):**

1. **Timing:** Apply after 6-12 months operational track record (Q4 2027 - Q2 2028)
2. **Submission Package:**
   - ADGM FSRA Category 3C approval letter (proving BLXWT regulatory standing)
   - BLXWT Technical White Paper (emphasizing non-redeemable structure)
   - EY monthly gold audit reports (12 months proof-of-reserve history)
   - Stress test results: Gold price -30% scenario still meets capital requirements
   - Legal opinion: Labuan counsel confirms BLXWT eligibility as Tier 1 supplement

3. **Precedent & Rationale:**
   - Similar to Central Bank Digital Gold structures (e.g., Singapore MAS Project Orchid)
   - BLXWT treated as illiquid commodity asset (90% haircut = ultra-conservative)
   - No redemption liability = stable capital base (superior to deposits)

4. **Expected Approval Probability:** 75% (based on precedent and conservative haircut)

**Phase 2 Supporting Documents (For 2028 Submission):**
- **Annex 6A:** ADGM FSRA Category 3C Approval Letter (2026)
- **Annex 6B:** BLXWT White Paper - Non-Redeemable Structure Analysis
- **Annex 6C:** EY Monthly Proof-of-Reserve Reports (12 months)
- **Annex 6D:** Capital Stress Test Results (Gold Price Shock Scenarios)
- **Annex 6E:** Legal Opinion - BLXWT as Tier 1 Capital (Labuan Counsel)

### A.2 BLXWT Classification & Usage Boundaries

**FSRA 2025 Virtual Asset Framework Compliance:**

> "Under FSRA's 2025 Virtual Asset Framework, BLXWT qualifies as a **non-redeemable, fully-backed commodity-linked virtual asset**, not a fiat-referenced token, and thus remains under the Category 3C 'Managing Assets' scope rather than Payment Services."

- **Settlement Role:** NONE - BLXWT does not settle transactions

  Proof-of-reserve     Payment execution
  Custody records      Settlement finality
        ↓                    ↓
    (Read-only)         (Full authority)
```
