## 6. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

### 6.1 PRU 2025 Capital Adequacy

| Requirement | FSRA Minimum | BLX CORE | Buffer | Status |
|-------------|--------------|----------|--------|--------|
| **Base Capital** | USD 250,000 | USD 1,500,000 | **600%** | ✅ |
| **Liquidity Buffer** | 3 months OpEx* | 8.5 months | **283%** | ✅ |

| **PII Insurance** | Board attestation | USD 5M (Lloyd's) | 2,000% | ✅ |

| **AUM -30%** | -USD 300K | USD 950K | 380% | ✅ Pass |
| **Revenue -50%** | -USD 500K | USD 750K | 300% | ✅ Pass |
| **Combined Stress** | -USD 700K | USD 550K | 220% | ✅ Pass |

### 6.2 Virtual Asset Framework 2025

**Non-Redeemable Commodity-Linked Structure:**

Under FSRA's 2025 Virtual Asset Framework, any future tokenization projects (including BLXWT) will be structured as **non-redeemable, fully-backed commodity-linked virtual assets**.

**Key Classification:**

| Element | BLX Implementation | VA Rules Reference | Status |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Asset Backing** | Physical gold (LBMA Fix) | §1.3(b) - Commodity | ✅ |
| **Redemption Rights** | Explicitly prohibited in smart contracts | §2.4 - Non-redeemable | ✅ |
| **Return Guarantees** | None provided | §2.6 - No issuer claims | ✅ |
| **Classification** | Commodity-linked (NOT fiat-referenced) | FRT exclusion | ✅ |
| **Regulatory Scope** | Category 3C 'Managing Assets' | NOT Payment Services | ✅ |
| **KYC/AML** | Chainalysis whitelist-based | §3.2 - VASP standards | ✅ |

**BLXWT Regulatory Position:**

BLXWT qualifies as a **non-redeemable, fully-backed commodity-linked virtual asset** under FSRA's 2025 Virtual Asset Framework. As it does NOT provide redemption rights or return guarantees, it falls outside Financial Regulated Token (FRT) classification and remains within Category 3C 'Managing Assets' scope rather than Payment Services.

**Smart Contract Security:**
- Annual audits: CertiK + OpenZeppelin (dual-firm standard)
- Bug bounty program: Immunefi (USD 10K-100K rewards)
- Code example:

```solidity
// CRITICAL: No redemption function
contract BLXRWAToken {
    function redeemAgainstIssuer() public pure {
        revert("Redemption not supported - Non-Financial Instrument");
    }
    
    // Commodity linkage only (LBMA Fix reference)
    function getPriceOracle() public view returns (uint256) {
        return chainlinkGoldPrice; // LBMA PM Fix
    }
    
    // Transfer restrictions (accredited investors only)
    function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to) internal {
        require(isWhitelisted(to), "Recipient not accredited");
    }
}
```

### 6.3 CRMF July 2025 (Voluntary Compliance)
