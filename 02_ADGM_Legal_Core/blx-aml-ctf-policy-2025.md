## 10.1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### 10.1.1 Purpose & Scope

This AML/CTF Policy establishes BLX Holdings' commitment to preventing money laundering, terrorist financing, and sanctions violations across all entities:

- **BLX CORE Ltd.** (FSRA Cat 3C - regulated)
- **BLX TRADING Co.** (Free Zone - non-regulated but policy applies)
- **DMHB DLT Foundation** (Foundation - crypto asset risks)
- **BLX REWARD Korea** (Equity method - Korea AML laws apply)

**Zero Tolerance:** No business relationship is worth compromising AML/CTF standards.

### 10.1.2 Risk-Based Approach

**BLX Holdings AML Risk Profile: MEDIUM-LOW**

| **Risk Factor** | **Level** | **Justification** |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Geographic** | Medium | ADGM (low-risk), Korea (medium), no high-risk jurisdictions |
| **Customer** | Low | Professional clients only (no retail), institutional focus |
| **Product** | Medium | Crypto assets (DMHB), gold custody (BLX CORE), but non-anonymous |
| **Delivery Channel** | Low | Face-to-face onboarding, no remote/online-only relationships |
| **Overall** | **Medium-Low** | Mitigated by strong controls, no cash business |

**Enhanced Risk Factor (FSRA 2025 Specific):**

| **Risk Factor** | **Level** | **Justification** |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Gold Supply Chain** | Medium-High | Physical commodity risk (conflict minerals, sanctions evasion) mitigated by LBMA-only sourcing |
| **Virtual Asset Custody** | Medium | BLXWT custody risk mitigated by non-redeemable structure, on-chain transparency |

## 10.7 SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY REPORTING (SAR)

### 10.7.1 SAR Decision Process

**When to File SAR:**

- MLRO determines: "Reasonable grounds to suspect" money laundering/terrorist financing
- Standard: Balance of probabilities (>50% likelihood), not "beyond reasonable doubt"
- **Examples:**
  - Client matches red flags (2+ indicators)
  - Sanctions screening alert unresolved
  - Client refuses to explain source of funds
  - Law enforcement inquiry (even if not yet criminal investigation)
  - **NEW:** Gold supplier cannot provide origin documentation
  - **NEW:** BLXWT transfer to sanctioned cryptocurrency address

**Decision Tree:**

```
Red Flag Identified
‚Üì
Relationship Manager escalates to MLRO (within 24 hours)
‚Üì
MLRO investigates (interviews client, reviews documents)
‚Üì
‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Explanation satisfactory? ‚Üí Document & close alert
‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Suspicion remains? ‚Üí File SAR
```

### 10.7.2 SAR Filing Requirements

**ADGM Process:**

1. **Internal SAR Report:**
   - Form: BLX SAR template (standardized, 5 pages)
   - Content: Who, what, when, where, why, how (5W1H)

2. **External Filing:**
   - Recipient: ADGM Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU)
   - Method: Secure portal (adgm.com/fiu)
   - Timeline: Within 15 days of suspicion arising (ADGM AML Rules ¬ß7.2)

3. **Tipping Off Prohibition:**
   - CANNOT inform client that SAR filed (criminal offense, 2 years jail)
   - Exception: If FIU gives written consent (rare)
   - Challenge: If client asks "why account frozen?" ‚Üí "Conducting enhanced due diligence per policy"

**SAR Statistics (2026 Target):**

- Total SARs: <10/year (low = good controls, not under-reporting)
- False SARs: <20% (where FIU finds no merit)
- Timeliness: 100% filed within 15 days

### 10.7.3 Post-SAR Actions

**Relationship Continuance Decision:**

- Default: Continue relationship unless FIU orders freeze or MLRO deems too high-risk
- Enhanced monitoring: Monthly (vs. quarterly) transaction reviews
- Consider exit: If pattern of suspicious activity (2+ SARs in 12 months)

**Law Enforcement Cooperation:**

- If FIU requests documents ‚Üí Provide within 48 hours
- If restraint order (asset freeze) ‚Üí Execute immediately, notify Board within 24 hours

## 10.8 BLXWT RESERVE MONITORING (FSRA 2025 SPECIFIC)

### 10.8.1 Reserve Backing Verification Framework

**Daily Reconciliation (Automated):**

1. **On-Chain BLXWT Supply:**
   - Source: Ethereum blockchain (ERC-20 contract)
   - Metric: Total BLXWT tokens in circulation
   - Tool: Etherscan API (real-time)

2. **Physical Gold Inventory:**
   - Source: Vault operator daily report (Brink's, Malca-Amit)
   - Metric: Kilograms of gold in segregated account
   - Conversion: 1 BLXWT = 1 gram of 99.5%+ purity gold

3. **Reconciliation Check:**
   - Formula: BLXWT Supply (grams) ‚â§ Physical Gold (grams)
   - Alert: If discrepancy >0.1% ‚Üí MLRO investigation
   - Resolution: Within 24 hours (recount inventory or freeze minting)

**Monthly Independent Audit:**

- Auditor: Bureau Veritas (ISO 17025 accredited)
- Scope: Physical count of gold bars + serial number verification
- Report: Delivered to MLRO, CFO, FSRA (upon request)
- Timeline: Audit conducted within first 5 business days of month

### 10.8.2 Minting/Burning Controls

**BLXWT Minting Process (Issuing New Tokens):**

1. **Gold Deposit Verification:**
   - BLX CORE receives gold from LBMA refiner (per Section 10.4)
   - Vault operator confirms receipt (serial numbers match refining certificate)
   - CFO approves deposit (accounting entry: Debit Inventory, Credit Reserves)

2. **MLRO Pre-Approval (If >USD 1M):**
   - Source of funds verification (if gold purchased from new supplier)
   - Sanctions screening (if gold originates from new jurisdiction)
   - Sign-off: MLRO confirms no AML/CFT concerns

3. **Smart Contract Minting:**
   - BLX CORE authorizes minting transaction (multi-signature wallet, 2-of-3)
   - On-chain: BLXWT contract mints new tokens (equivalent to gold deposited)
   - Public record: Transaction hash published (transparency)

**BLXWT Burning Process (Removing Tokens):**

1. **Token Redemption Request:**
   - NOTE: BLXWT is non-redeemable for fiat, but tokens may be burned if:
     - DAO governance decision (treasury management)
     - Physical gold sold (rebalancing reserves)

2. **Reserve Reduction Verification:**
   - CFO confirms physical gold withdrawal from vault
   - Accounting: Debit Reserves, Credit Cash (if gold sold)

3. **Smart Contract Burning:**
   - BLX CORE authorizes burn transaction (multi-signature, 2-of-3)
   - On-chain: BLXWT contract burns tokens (equivalent to gold withdrawn)
   - Public record: Transaction hash published

### 10.8.3 Anomaly Detection (Red Flags)

**Reserve Monitoring Red Flags:**

- Discrepancy >0.5% between BLXWT supply and physical gold (beyond rounding)
- Minting without corresponding vault deposit confirmation
- Vault operator reports missing serial numbers
- Gold purity below 99.5% (refinery certificate error)
- Multiple recount requests (potential inventory manipulation)

**Immediate Action:**

1. Freeze minting (smart contract pause function)
2. MLRO + CFO investigation (within 24 hours)
3. Independent recount (external auditor, emergency engagement)
4. If fraud suspected ‚Üí File SAR + notify FSRA
5. Public disclosure (if material, >1% of reserves affected)

## 10.11 EMERGING RISKS & TECHNOLOGY

### 10.11.1 Crypto Asset Risks (DMHB DLT Specific)

**Risks:**
- Anonymity: Mixers/tumblers (Tornado Cash) obfuscate fund origin
- Speed: Cross-border in minutes (vs. days for traditional banking)
- Irreversibility: Cannot "cancel" transaction after blockchain confirmation

**Mitigations:**

1. **Chainalysis Integration:**
   - Real-time screening: All DMHB wallet addresses
   - Alert: If counterparty interacted with sanctioned address (e.g., OFAC SDN wallets)
   - Risk score: 0-100 (>80 = high-risk, require EDD)

2. **FATF Travel Rule Compliance:**
   - For transactions >USD 1,000: Capture originator/beneficiary data
   - Challenge: Decentralized exchanges don't collect KYC
   - Solution: Only deal with KYC-compliant exchanges (Coinbase, Binance)

3. **Stablecoin Risks (USDC/USDT):**
   - USDC: Centre Consortium (Circle + Coinbase) blocks sanctioned addresses ‚úÖ
   - USDT (Tether): Less transparent, avoid if possible ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - BLX policy: 80% USDC, 20% USDT max (prefer USDC)

### 10.11.2 BLXWT-Specific Virtual Asset Risks

**Risk: Non-Redeemable Structure Misunderstanding**

- **Scenario:** Client believes BLXWT can be redeemed for fiat, attempts money laundering through conversion
- **Mitigation:**
  - Clear disclosure: All onboarding documents state "non-redeemable"
  - Client acknowledgment: Signed declaration understanding BLXWT is commodity-linked, not payment token
  - Transaction monitoring: Flag attempts to use BLXWT as payment method (prohibited)

**Risk: Gold Reserve Manipulation**

- **Scenario:** Fraudulent minting (BLXWT issued without corresponding gold deposit)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Multi-signature wallet (2-of-3: CEO, CFO, MLRO)
  - Daily reconciliation (automated alerts)
  - Monthly independent audit (Bureau Veritas)
  - On-chain transparency (public verification of reserves)

**Risk: Layering via BLXWT**

- **Scenario:** Criminal converts fiat ‚Üí BLXWT ‚Üí cryptocurrency ‚Üí clean fiat
- **Mitigation:**
  - KYC at entry point (BLX CORE onboarding)
  - Chainalysis monitoring (flag subsequent transfers to mixers)
  - No anonymous BLXWT acquisition (100% institutional clients, face-to-face)

### 10.11.3 AI/ML for Transaction Monitoring (2027 Pilot)

**Current State (2026):** Rule-based alerts (threshold triggers)

**Future State (2027):** Machine learning anomaly detection

- Model: Supervised learning (trained on 5 years historical transactions + known SARs)
- Features: Transaction size, frequency, geography, customer profile (30+ variables)
- Benefit: Detect subtle patterns (e.g., "client suddenly wires to 5 new countries")
- Reduce false positives: From 10% ‚Üí 3% (ML adapts to client behavior)

**Vendor Shortlist:**
- Feedzai (Tier 1 banks use, USD 200K/year)
- ComplyAdvantage (fintech-focused, USD 100K/year)
- Build in-house (leveraging BLX data science team, 2028+)

## 10.13 CROSS-BORDER AML CONSIDERATIONS

### 10.13.1 Multi-Jurisdictional Framework

**BLX Holdings operates across 3 primary jurisdictions:**

| **Entity** | **Jurisdiction** | **Primary Regulator** | **AML/CTF Framework** |
|------------|------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **BLX CORE Ltd.** | ADGM (UAE) | FSRA | ADGM AML/CTF Rules 2024 |
| **BLX TRADING Co.** | ADGM (UAE) | None (Free Zone) | ADGM AML/CTF Rules (voluntary compliance) |
| **DMHB DLT Foundation** | Labuan IBFC (Malaysia) | Labuan FSA | Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001 (AMLA) |
| **BLX REWARD Korea** | South Korea | FSC (Financial Services Commission) | Act on Reporting and Using Specified Financial Transaction Information |

**Unified AML Standard:**

- BLX Holdings applies the **highest standard** across all entities
- Where ADGM rules stricter ‚Üí Apply to all entities
- Where Korea rules stricter ‚Üí Apply to all entities
- Result: No regulatory arbitrage, consistent global controls

### 10.13.2 Labuan FSA Coordination (DMHB DLT)

**Labuan-Specific Requirements:**

1. **Compliance Officer (CO) Appointment:**
   - Required: Labuan-licensed CO (cannot be same person as ADGM MLRO)
   - Appointment: Within 30 days of DMHB DLT Foundation incorporation
   - Reporting: CO reports to Labuan FSA (independent of BLX Holdings Board)

2. **Suspicious Transaction Reporting (STR):**
   - Recipient: Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) Financial Intelligence and Enforcement Department (FIED)
   - Timeline: Within 14 days (vs. ADGM 15 days - stricter standard applied)
   - Format: BNM STR Form (separate from ADGM SAR)

3. **Record Keeping:**
   - Retention: 6 years (aligned with ADGM)
   - Location: Records may be stored in ADGM (cross-border access agreement)

**Data Interface Only (Critical Distinction):**

- DMHB DLT handles payment/settlement execution under Labuan FSA jurisdiction
- BLX CORE provides reserve monitoring data only (no payment authority)
- AML/CTF responsibility: Labuan CO for settlements, ADGM MLRO for custody
- **No cross-border payment execution by BLX CORE** (avoids FSRA Payment Services classification)

### 10.13.3 Korea AML Compliance (BLX REWARD)

**Korea-Specific Requirements:**

1. **Real Name Verification:**
   - All beneficiaries: National ID verification (Korean nationals)
   - Foreigners: Alien registration card (ARC) verification

2. **Large Cash Transaction Reporting (CTR):**
   - Threshold: KRW 10M (~USD 7,500) single transaction
   - BLX REWARD policy: No cash accepted (eliminates CTR requirement)

3. **AML Officer Registration:**
   - Required: Register with Financial Intelligence Unit Korea (FIU Korea)
   - Certification: Complete FIU Korea AML training (8 hours, Korean language)

**Equity Method Limitation:**

- BLX Holdings owns 40% of BLX REWARD Korea (equity method, not consolidated)
- AML responsibility: BLX REWARD Korea's own Board + management
- BLX Holdings oversight: Annual AML audit (included in PwC scope)

---

## 10.14 SANCTIONS EVASION TECHNIQUES (AWARENESS)

### 10.14.1 Common Evasion Methods (Red Flags)

**Gold Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML):**

- **Technique:** Over/under-invoicing gold purchases
  - Example: Buy gold at USD 60/gram (market: USD 65), pay difference in cash
  - Purpose: Move value across borders without detection
- **BLX Mitigation:** All gold purchases at spot price ¬±2% (documented justification required)

**Shell Company Layering:**

- **Technique:** Use 3+ offshore companies to obscure UBO
  - Example: Dubai company owned by Cayman company owned by BVI company owned by sanctioned individual
- **BLX Mitigation:** UBO verification (pierce all layers until natural person identified)

**Crypto Mixing:**

- **Technique:** Send funds through Tornado Cash (mixer), withdraw "clean" crypto
  - Example: Sanctioned party ‚Üí mixer ‚Üí BLXWT purchase attempt
- **BLX Mitigation:** Chainalysis screening flags mixer interaction, transaction rejected

**Trade Mis-Invoicing:**

- **Technique:** Declare wrong commodity value/quantity in customs
  - Example: Export gold declared as "jewelry" (lower value) to avoid scrutiny
- **BLX Mitigation:** Not applicable (BLX doesn't export gold, custody only)

**Smurfing/Structuring:**

- **Technique:** Break large transaction into small amounts below reporting threshold
  - Example: 10 transactions √ó USD 9,000 = USD 90,000 (avoiding USD 10K CTR)
- **BLX Mitigation:** Aggregate monitoring (7-day cumulative threshold, Section 10.6.2)

### 10.14.2 Gold-Specific Sanctions Risks

**High-Risk Gold Origins (Prohibited):**

| **Country/Region** | **Risk Type** | **BLX Policy** |
|-------------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Venezuela** | Government-controlled, OFAC sanctioned | ‚ùå Prohibited |
| **Iran** | UN/US/EU sanctions | ‚ùå Prohibited |
| **DRC (Artisanal)** | Conflict minerals, child labor | ‚ùå Prohibited (unless UN-certified) |
| **Sudan** | Sanctions (partially lifted, high-risk) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Enhanced due diligence required |
| **Russia (post-2022)** | UK/EU sanctions on Russian gold | ‚ùå Prohibited (LBMA-compliant) |

**LBMA Refiner Delisting Events:**

- **Example (2023):** Russian refiners removed from LBMA Good Delivery List
- **BLX Action:** Immediate supplier suspension if delisted
- **Timeline:** Daily monitoring of LBMA list updates
