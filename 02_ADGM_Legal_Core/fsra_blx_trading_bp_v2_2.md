## 4.2 PETROLEUM TRADING OPERATIONS

### 4.2.1 Product Specification

**Primary Product: EN590 Diesel**

| Specification | Value | Standard |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| Product Name | EN590 10ppm Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel | European Standard |
| Sulfur Content | ≤10 ppm | EN590:2013 |
| Cetane Number | ≥51 | EN590:2013 |
| Flash Point | ≥55°C | ASTM D93 |
| Density @ 15°C | 820-845 kg/m³ | ISO 3675 |
| Viscosity | 2.0-4.5 mm²/s | ISO 3104 |

**Why EN590?**
✅ Global demand (primary diesel standard in Europe, Asia)
✅ Premium quality (low sulfur = environmental compliance)
✅ Price transparency (MOPS/Platts pricing benchmark)
✅ Established supply chain (major refineries, traders)

### 4.2.2 Trading Strategy

**Conservative "Spot Delivery" Model:**
- NO futures/options trading (eliminates speculation risk)
- NO inventory holding >7 days (minimizes price risk)
- Back-to-back contracts only (supplier → BLX → buyer)

**Transaction Flow:**
```
Step 1: Buyer Inquiry (SK Energy, GS Caltex, etc.)
Step 2: Price Quote (MOPS -10% discount, USD/MT)
Step 3: Supplier Sourcing (Vitol, Trafigura, Gunvor)
Step 4: Contract Execution (LOI → SPA within 24 hours)
Step 5: Logistics Coordination (Vessel charter, insurance)
Step 6: Payment & Delivery (LC payment at loading port)
Step 7: Settlement (T+3 days, wire transfer)
```

**Pricing Mechanism:**
- Benchmark: MOPS (Mean of Platts Singapore) spot price
- Discount: -10% (standard for bulk purchases)
- Example: MOPS = USD 800/MT → Offer price = USD 720/MT
- Margin: USD 80-120/MT (10-15% net margin after costs)

### 4.2.3 Target Markets

## 4.3 GOLD CONVERSION STRATEGY

### 4.3.1 Gold Acquisition Policy

**Core Principle:** Convert 95% of net profits to physical gold

**Rationale:**
1. **Capital Preservation:** Gold historically maintains purchasing power
2. **Labuan Bank Preparation:** Building reserves for 2027-2028 DMH BANK
3. **Reserve Backing:** Gold reserves for future cross-border settlement framework
4. **Inflation Hedge:** Protects against fiat currency devaluation

### 4.3.2 Gold Purchase Protocol

**Specifications:**
- Type: LBMA Good Delivery Bars
- Weight: 400 troy oz (12.4 kg) bars
- Purity: 99.5% minimum (995 fineness)
- Certification: LBMA-certified refiner (Heraeus, PAMP, etc.)

**AML/CFT Gold Source Traceability:**

All gold acquisitions comply with ADGM Virtual Asset AML Guidance 2025:
- **LBMA-accredited refineries only** (Good Delivery List verification)
- **Chain-of-custody documentation** (mine-to-vault tracking)
- **Conflict mineral screening** (OECD Due Diligence Guidance)
- **Refinery certification** (annual LBMA audit compliance)
- **Third-party verification** (Big 4 auditor quarterly physical counts)

**Purchase Process:**
```
Step 1: Quarterly Net Profit Calculation
   └─→ Example: Q1 2026 = USD 14.4M net income

Step 2: Gold Allocation (95%)
   └─→ USD 13.68M allocated to gold purchase

Step 3: Supplier Selection (Competitive Bidding from LBMA List)
   ├─→ Supplier A: USD 2,400/oz (LBMA-certified, conflict-free)
   ├─→ Supplier B: USD 2,405/oz
   └─→ Winner: Supplier A (verified chain-of-custody)

Step 4: Purchase Order + AML Documentation
   └─→ Quantity: 5,700 oz (14.25 bars)
   └─→ Refinery certificate + OECD compliance attestation

Step 5: Payment & Delivery
   ├─→ Payment: Wire transfer (SWIFT)
   ├─→ Delivery: 7-10 days to LBMA-certified vault
   └─→ Insurance: Lloyd's all-risk coverage

Step 6: Transfer to BLX CORE Reserve Monitoring
   └─→ Legal transfer: BLX TRADING → Third-party custodian
   └─→ BLX CORE: Arranges custody & monitoring (not direct custody)
```

**Gold Suppliers (LBMA-Accredited):**
- Primary: Heraeus Precious Metals (Germany)
- Backup: PAMP Suisse, Perth Mint (Australia)
- Verification: Annual LBMA audit compliance check

### 4.3.3 Gold Accumulation Targets

**5-Year Gold Acquisition Plan (Conservative):**

| Year | Net Profit (USD) | Gold Allocated (95%) | Gold Price (USD/oz) | Gold Acquired (oz) | Cumulative Gold (oz) |
|------|------------------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| 2026 | 57,600,000 | 54,720,000 | 2,000 | 27,360 | 27,360 |
| 2027 | 85,800,000 | 81,510,000 | 2,100 | 38,814 | 66,174 |
| 2028 | 119,340,000 | 113,373,000 | 2,200 | 51,533 | 117,707 |
| 2029 | 165,060,000 | 156,807,000 | 2,300 | 68,177 | 185,884 |
| 2030 | 215,820,000 | 205,029,000 | 2,400 | 85,429 | 271,313 |

**Note:** This is significantly lower than original projection (466,471 oz by 2030) due to:
- Conservative net margin (15% vs. 70% previously)
- Realistic trading volumes (384K MT Year 1 vs. 500K MT)
- Gold price appreciation (USD 2,000 → USD 2,400)

**Revised Target for Labuan DMH BANK:**
- 2027 Target: 66,174 oz (USD 138.9M @ USD 2,100/oz)
- Sufficient for RM 20M (USD 4.2M) minimum capital ✅
- Remaining gold: Strategic reserve for future cross-border settlement framework integration

## 4.6 RISK MANAGEMENT

### 4.6.1 Risk Matrix

**Top 5 Risks:**

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Oil Price Crash (>30%) | Medium | High | Back-to-back contracts, 7-day max holding |
| Supplier Default | Low | High | Multi-supplier strategy, LC payments |
| Buyer Credit Risk | Medium | Medium | Prepayment or LC only, credit insurance |
| Geopolitical (Iran/Saudi conflict) | Low | High | Supply diversification, emergency sourcing |
| FX Risk (USD/KRW) | Medium | Low | Natural hedge (KRW revenues from BLX REWARD) |

### 4.6.2 Hedging Strategy

**Price Risk Hedging:**
- Primary: Back-to-back contracts (locks in margin at contract signing)
- Secondary: MOPS futures (hedge 20% of exposure if needed)
- Tools: CME Group diesel futures, ICE Brent swaps

**Example Hedge (if needed):**
```
Scenario: Signed contract with SK Energy for 10K MT @ USD 720/MT
Delivery: 30 days from now
Risk: MOPS drops to USD 650/MT (margin erosion)

Hedge:
- Sell 10K MT MOPS futures @ USD 800/MT
- If MOPS drops to USD 650/MT:
  ├─→ Physical loss: USD (150)/MT × 10K = USD -1.5M
  └─→ Futures gain: USD 150/MT × 10K = USD +1.5M
Result: Net margin protected at USD 120/MT
```

**FX Hedging:**
- Natural hedge: BLX REWARD receives KRW (5% of profit)
- No active FX hedging unless exposure >USD 5M

### 4.6.3 Compliance & Sanctions

- Tool: Refinitiv World-Check
- Frequency: Real-time (all counterparties)

## 4.7 INTEGRATION WITH BLX ECOSYSTEM

### 4.7.1 Intercompany Transactions

**BLX TRADING → BLX CORE (Gold Reserve Transfer):**
```
Frequency: Quarterly
Process:
1. BLX TRADING purchases gold from LBMA-accredited refinery (conflict-free certification)
2. Gold delivered to LBMA-certified third-party custodian (Brink's/Loomis/Malca-Amit)
3. BLX CORE arranges custody (not direct custody - Category 3C compliant)
4. Transfer pricing: Cost + 1% coordination fee
5. BLX CORE provides reserve monitoring services
```

**CRITICAL LEGAL BOUNDARY:**
- BLX TRADING: Purchases gold (commodity trading)
- Third-party custodian: Holds physical gold (licensed vault operator)
- BLX CORE: Arranges custody + monitors reserves (Category 3C activity)

- Annual review: Ensure UAE/Korea tax treaty compliance

**BLX TRADING → BLX REWARD Korea (Cash Transfer):**
```
Frequency: Quarterly
Amount: 5% of net profit
Process:
1. BLX TRADING calculates net profit (audited quarterly)
2. 5% remitted to BLX REWARD Korea (SWIFT wire)
3. Purpose: Welfare program funding (not dividends)
4. Documentation: Grant agreement (not taxable in Korea)
```

**FX Declaration:**
- Korea Bank of Korea: Report remittances >USD 10K
- Purpose code: "Social contribution" (exempts from withholding tax)

### 4.7.2 Consolidated Reporting

2. **BLX REWARD Korea:**
   - Stable funding source (USD 2.88M Year 1 → USD 10.8M Year 5)
   - 4,700 households → 25,000 households impact scaling
