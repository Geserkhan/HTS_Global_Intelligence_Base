## 3.7 RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

### 3.7.1 Risk Taxonomy

**5 Risk Categories (FSRA GEN 5.3 Compliance):**

1. **Market Risk**
   - Gold price volatility (spot price fluctuations)
   - Real estate market cycles (Korean property downturn)
   - Interest rate risk (PRIDE LAND debt financing costs)
   - Currency risk (KRW/USD exchange rate)

2. **Liquidity Risk**
   - Real estate illiquidity (PRIDE LAND 3-year lock-up)
   - Redemption pressure (investor withdrawals)
   - Gold reserve liquidity (time to monetize in stress)
   - Funding risk (BLX TRADING parent support dependency)

3. **Operational Risk**
   - System failure (PMS, CRM, monitoring system downtime)
   - Human error (trade execution mistakes, valuation errors)
   - Third-party custodian failure (Brink's insolvency, fraud)
   - Cyber attack (ransomware, data breach, phishing)
   - Key person dependency (CEO/MLRO departure)

4. **Compliance Risk**
   - Regulatory breach (FSRA rule violation)
   - AML/CTF failure (sanctions screening miss, SAR delay)
   - Mis-selling (unsuitable client investments)
   - Reporting error (inaccurate FSRA filings)
   - Virtual Asset misclassification (FRT vs. non-FRT)

5. **Reputation Risk**
   - ESG controversy (PRIDE LAND labor dispute)
   - Litigation (investor lawsuit)
   - Media criticism (negative press coverage)
   - Client complaint escalation (FSRA referral)
   - Parent company issues (BLX TRADING operational failures)

|--------|---------|
| **Buyer Profile** | Larger ADGM asset manager (USD 5B+ AUM) seeking ESG/RWA capabilities |
| **Valuation Method** | 3-5x EBITDA (Year 5: USD 5M EBITDA × 4 = USD 20M enterprise value) |

**Scenario 2: IPO (20% probability)**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|

| **Exit Probability** | 20% (ADGM IPO market still nascent) |

**Scenario 3: Continued Operations (40% probability)**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Strategy** | Organic growth as BLX Holdings subsidiary (no external sale) |
| **Dividend Policy** | 50% payout ratio (post-Year 3, subject to PRU compliance) |
| **Expansion Plan** | New asset classes (infrastructure, private credit, venture capital) |
| **Geographic Growth** | Vietnam, Philippines, Indonesia (ASEAN expansion) |

**Exit Decision Framework:**

```
Decision Tree (Board Review - Annual)
│
├─ Is AUM > USD 1B? (Yes/No)
│   ├─ YES → Evaluate strategic sale or IPO
│   └─ NO → Continue organic growth
│
├─ Is EBITDA margin > 20%? (Yes/No)
│   ├─ YES → Consider dividend distribution
│   └─ NO → Reinvest in growth
│
├─ Is Labuan bank profitable? (Yes/No)
│   ├─ YES → Maximum valuation achieved (consider exit)
│   └─ NO → Delay exit decision (2+ years)
│
└─ Is market M&A multiple attractive? (>5x EBITDA?)
    ├─ YES → Engage investment bank advisor
